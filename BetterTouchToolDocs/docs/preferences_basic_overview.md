#Basic Preferences Overview
This section wants to give you an overview of the BetterTouchTools preferences. The window you see in the screenshot below is where you can configure almost every feature available in BetterTouchTool (and there are many ðŸ˜‰)

Let's dive into the different parts of that window:

##Application List
Actions in BetterTouchTool can either be assigned to a specific application or globally. 
To add a new application click the âž• button on the bottom left of the list (or alternatively drag an app directly onto the list from Finder). To delete an application press the âž– button. 
**Pressing the - button will delete the application and all gestures / triggers you have associated with it.**

## Copying Gestures, App Specifics
* You can drag gestures onto apps in the list. This will create an exact copy of the gesture for that app.
* You can click the *App Specific* button which allows you to copy all gestures from one app to another app. The button also allows you to disable *single finger scrolling*, *window snapping* or the whole *BetterTouchTool* for a specific application.
