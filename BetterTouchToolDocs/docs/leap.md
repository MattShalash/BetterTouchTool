#Leap Motion

**Deprecation Info**
```
I'm currently not sure how well the BetterTouchTool Leap integration works with the current Leap Motion Software.
As I broke my Leap Motion Controller, and the interest in the Leap support in BetterTouchTool has declined a lot, I'm now deprecating support for it in BTT.

The current functionality will continue to stay in BTT, but there probably won't be any further updates to the Leap Motion integration.
