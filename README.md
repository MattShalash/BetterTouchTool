## BetterTouchTool Documentation

The BetterTouchTool documentation can be found [here](http://docs.bettertouchtool.com/). Pull requests on the BetterTouchTool documentation (which is hosted on this repo) are always very welcome.

To build the BetterTouchTool Documentation follow these steps:

* Install Node.js (I recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install Node. Current long term support version of Node.js is v6.9.1).
* Run ``npm install -g gitbook-cli``
* cd into the BetterTouchToolDocs directory and run ``node yarn-0.17.10.js install``
* run ``gitbook serve`` to build and run the documentation
* run ``gitbook build`` to just build the documentation
